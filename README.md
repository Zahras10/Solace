# 🏗️ Solace – NYC School Construction Estimator

Solace is an intelligent, interactive Streamlit web application designed to estimate the **cost and schedule** of school construction projects in New York City. Powered by machine learning models and the Mistral LLM API, it delivers data-driven insights and detailed construction plans for all 8 project phases.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Estimate total cost and duration based on a project description and cost tier (Low, Mid, High)
- 📋 Get phase-wise breakdowns of:
  - Description
  - Subtasks
  - Required NYC permissions (SCA, DoE, FDNY)
  - Vendors and labor estimation
- 📊 Interactive charts and metrics for better visualization
- 💡 Dark mode toggle
- 🎥 Lottie animations for modern UI
- 📤 Downloadable results as Excel and PDF (coming soon)
- 🧠 Uses:
  - Mistral LLM API for phase plan generation
  - SentenceTransformer (BERT) for embedding descriptions
  - Trained ML models for cost and duration prediction

## 🚀 Tech Stack
